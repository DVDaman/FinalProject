# FinalProject
We started off thinking that we could make the make a full game with enemies and npcs. 
We thought that we would be able to use the code from the zelda walkthrough we viewed in class however, we weren't able to block the player when it came into contact with the blocks. 
This was because it was an image gliding
over another image. 
This stoped us from getting the x and y coordinates of the map and the player. We fixed this by making the player a sprite.
Unfortunately we still had to remake the map this allowed us to take the x and y coordinates. A massive problem that we ran into was that 
Daniele's code ran using os.path.join() however Curran's codes couldn't function with this. 
With os.path.join() not functioning, Curran had to change and add every new tile that Daniele made.
Since the code between the two was different we thought that Curran would just send the code to Daniele he would add it change it to work with the os.path.join() then up load it to github.
Daniele worked on the map and map editor while, Curran worked on the blocking and and moving of the player. 
We used https://www.youtube.com/user/meloonaticmelons/videos?shelf_id=4&view=0&sort=p for a large part of this project. 
Nevertheless, this wasn't the miracle solution. 
He made his code very different; the way he called the player and the map differed from ours. 
Coming to the end of the semester Daniele found a way to send a player from one map to another when the player steps on a certain block.
